    # GKNV93 p. 9: An initial feasible ranking is computed. For
    # brevity, init_rank is not given here. Our version keeps nodes in
    # a queue. Nodes are placed in the queue when they have no
    # unscanned in-edges. As nodes are taken off the queue, they are
    # assigned the least rank that satisfies their in-edges, and their
    # out-edges are marked as scanned. In the simplest case, where Î´ =
    # 1 for all edges, this corresponds to viewing the graph as a
    # poset and assigning the minimal elements to rank 0. These nodes
    # are removed from the poset and the new set of minimal elements
    # are assigned rank 1, etc.
